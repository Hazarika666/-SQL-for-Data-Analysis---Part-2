[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) is a popular website run by Y Combinator. Itâ€™s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, I worked with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

- title: the title of the story
- user: the user who submitted the story
- score: the score of the story
- timestamp: the time of the story
- url: the link of the story
