CoolTShirts, an innovative apparel shop, is running a bunch of marketing campaigns. In this project, I answered the following questions about their campaigns:

1. Get familiar with the company.
- How many campaigns and sources does CoolTShirts use and how are they related? 
- What pages are on their website?

2. What is the user journey?
- How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?
- How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?
- How many visitors make a purchase?
- How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?
- What is the typical user journey?

3. Optimize the campaign budget. CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Which should they pick and why?
