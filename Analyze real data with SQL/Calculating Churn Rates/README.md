Codeflix, a streaming video startup, is interested in measuring their user churn rate. In this project, I answered the following questions about their churn:

1. Get familiar with the company.

- How many months has the company been operating? 
- Which months do you have enough information to calculate a churn rate?
- What segments of users exist?

2. What is the overall churn trend since the company started?

3. Compare the churn rates between user segments.
- Which segment of users should the company focus on expanding?
