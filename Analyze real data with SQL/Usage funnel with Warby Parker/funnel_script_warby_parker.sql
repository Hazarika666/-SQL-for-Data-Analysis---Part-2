Which question(s) of the quiz have a lower completion rates?

74.8% - What do you think is the reason? 

What do you think is the reason?

PART 2 - A/B testing
Letâ€™s find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase.
50% of the users will get 3 pairs to try on and 50% of the users will get 5 pairs to try on.
