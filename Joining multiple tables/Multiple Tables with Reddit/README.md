Description: 
For this project, I worked with some fictional data from Reddit, a social news aggregation, content rating site. On Reddit, users can create posts with content such as text, media, and links to other websites. Users can post content to different communities known as subreddits, which focus on a particular topic. Users can then rate othersâ€™ content by upvoting or downvoting them, and each post will show its total cumulative score.
I was given three tables:
* 		users: users data
* 		posts: posts information
* 		subreddits: information about subreddits
