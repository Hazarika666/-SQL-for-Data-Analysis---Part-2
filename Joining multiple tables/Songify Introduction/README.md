Description:

In this challenge, I performed analysis for Songify - a fictional music streaming service. Songify has a “freemium” model, meaning that it offers both a free product and a premium paid product.
I worked with with six tables:
* 		plans
* 		users
* 		premium_users
* 		songs
* 		months
* 		plays
